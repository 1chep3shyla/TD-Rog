  history: '

    In the ages of antiquity, when the lands were infused with magic
    and enchantment, arose the great knight named Sirius Steelheart. His lineage
    was renowned for their loyalty and service to the kingdom, and Sirius was no
    exception. He grew up honing the art of martial prowess and justice, adhering
    to the code of chivalry.



    With a sword in hand and a heart filled with
    goodness, Sirius participated in numerous battles, defending his people against
    dark forces and ominous creatures awakened by dark arcana. He became a symbol
    of hope for those in distress and a guardian of justice for all who transgressed
    the laws.



    Sirius Steelheart became known as the Great Knight, thanks to
    his magnificence in battles and unwavering honor in every endeavor. He was the
    best of his kind, and his legend spread throughout the kingdom.



    Since
    then, the Great Knight has become a symbol of nobility, justice, and courage.
    The legend of his exploits continues to inspire new generations of knights and
    champions of the light.'
