  history: "In the depths of the mysterious world of Elistar, where ancient magic
    lingered in every breath, Assasina was born \u2014 a guardian of shadows and
    secrets. Her story became a weaving of mystical currents, where every step remained
    unnoticed.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of a power whose source was immersed in
    ancient legends, Assasina gained abilities that transported her between light
    and darkness. Sheltered by shadows, she became a weapon in the hands of a mysterious
    entity known as the Shadow, promising her the opportunity for vengeance in exchange
    for loyalty.\r\n\r\nHer path led through the dense shadows of forgotten corridors
    and ancient forests, where every leaf was a witness to her invisible presence.
    Assasina became an executor of secret contracts, an inconspicuous instrument
    for those who needed her services.\r\n\r\nBut a shadow of questions crept into
    her heart. She unraveled the secrets of her past to unveil the mysteries of her
    present. The Shadow granted her power, but also dark secrets that had to be unraveled.\r\n\r\nIn
    the world of Elistar, where darkness and light danced in the eternal confrontation,
    Assasina became not only an agent of vengeance but also a guardian of balance.
    Her fate intertwined with the history of Elistar, remaining unknown and mysterious,
    like the very shadow that permeated her existence."
