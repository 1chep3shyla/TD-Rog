  history: 'Deep in the mountains, in a secluded mountain settlement, lived a gnome
    named Kragmor. He was a powerhouse and defender of his people. Everyone knew
    him as an unwavering warrior, battling monsters to ensure the safety of his loved
    ones.



    But behind the sturdy armor and steel shield hid a poignant story.
    In his youth, Kragmor was in love with a beautiful gnome named Phailin. Their
    love seemed unbreakable, but wars and dangers lurked around every corner.



    One
    day, during a brutal attack by the Shadow Servants of the Assassin, Kragmor sent
    Phailin to a hiding place, promising to return. He fought the assassins, but
    upon his return, he found their home destroyed, and Phailin gone. He traversed
    every mountain path, searched every cave, but she was nowhere to be found.



    The
    bitter pain of loss stayed with Kragmor, making him internally shattered. He
    continued to protect his people, but his heart was filled with sorrow. His eyes
    often flickered with sadness and unspoken grief.



    Every day, in his ongoing
    struggle, Kragmor hoped to see his love again. His dream was the heavy burden
    he carried along with his strength and endless sorrow.'
