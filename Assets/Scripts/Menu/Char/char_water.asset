  history: "In the quiet village of Elistar, surrounded by gentle rivers and green
    meadows, a girl named Liliana grew up. From an early age, she had a connection
    with water \u2014 an element that obeyed her as an older sister.\r\n\r\nHer power
    over water caused astonishment and awe in the village. People dubbed her \"Tempest
    Summoner\" because of her ability to summon water elements. She could create
    tiny water whirlwinds and tame downpours, turning them into gentle raindrops.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    with the gift came shadows. Liliana felt an unknown melancholy inside her, linked
    to some great tragedy. Often at night, when the stars twinkled in the sky, she
    heard the whispers of water spirits, foretelling sad events that awaited her.\r\n\r\nOne
    day, when the village was hit by a terrible storm, Liliana decided to use her
    abilities to protect her loved ones. She summoned rain, but with that rain came
    a storm stronger than she could foresee.\r\n\r\nWater whirlwinds turned into
    an uncontrollable stream, flooding the village. Liliana lost her family and friends
    under the weight of her own powers. Her water abilities brought unrest instead
    of protection.\r\n\r\nNow, in solitude, she wanders through Elistar, trying to
    understand and reconcile with her gift, which seemed to her like a curse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
